[DHS_methods.Rmd](../../docs/vignettes/DHS_methods.pdf)

### 2) Time Series Offset
This vignette demonstrates how to use the offset analysis tools to find the temporal offset in days between wastewater and case measurements.
[time_series_offset.Rmd](../../docs/vignettes/time_series_offset.pdf)

### 3) Linear Forest
This package contains a Linear Forest modeling tool for finding an optimal breakdown of linear components. This is most useful for looking for cofactors to the N1 vs case data.

Goal:
	show current state of analysis
	make significant step toward wrapping up project

start:
	cases vs N1 (smooth plus ambiguity, outliers)
	supplementary:  N2;  geomean (N1, N2)...

1.  Linear model show SE scales as N1
    	   figure:  some regression figure

    caveats;  role in analysis is limited to heuristic for choosing
    weights
	however, not sufficient weights (only outliers for qPCR)

    brian:  mmsd vs all data plot:
    	    var vs SE  plusses and minuses
	    question:  other normalizations?

2. smoothing of N1 for Madison
   	     brian:  provide interactive link for him and pdf with presets for
   	     span, min.weights max.weights;

	     include clear code that exposes only what we want him to
	     use


	     others:  2 versions with span
	     
	     	     pdf

3. smoothing of N1 for interceptors; for dorms (fall and winter
separate)

4.  supplement:  N2; geomean
    		 other wwpts


5 cases+WW measurements for MMSD
  a. smoothed cases below smoothed N1 (geomean, N2)
    two versions of span  (one version of cases?)
  b. same for UW and interceptors;


6. other info:  update %BCoV and PMMoV analysis

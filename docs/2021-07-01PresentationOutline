Goal:
	show current state of analysis
	make significant step toward wrapping up project

start:
	cases vs N1 (smooth plus ambiguity, outliers)
	supplementary:  N2;  geomean (N1, N2)...

1.  Linear model show SE scales as N1
    	   figure:  some regression figure

    caveats;  role in analysis is limited to heuristic for choosing

    weights
	however, not sufficient weights (only outliers for qPCR)

weight		
brian:  mmsd vs all data plot:
    
    	    var vs SE  plusses and minuses
	    question:  other normalizations?

2. smoothing of N1 for Madison
   	     brian:  provide interactive link for him and pdf with presets for
   	     span, min.weights max.weights;

	     include clear code that exposes only what we want him to
	     use


	     others:  2 versions with span
	     
	     	     pdf

3. smoothing of N1 for interceptors; for dorms (fall and winter
separate)  todo: exact dates for fall end and winter start
	   work on:  interceptors;
	   

4.  supplement:  N2; geomean
    		 other wwpts


5 cases+WW measurements for MMSD
  a. smoothed cases below smoothed N1 (geomean, N2)

     two versions of span  (one version of cases?)
    todo: smoothing for case data;
    
  b. same for UW and interceptors;
  

6. other info:  update %BCoV and PMMoV analysis

=============
research  questions or future work
	  1. shedding lag distribution: cases or N1
	  2. better lm
	     	    log-log model e.g.
	  3. limma heirarchical model
	  
	  correlation case with N1

	  Brian: ts package for correlation of time series;

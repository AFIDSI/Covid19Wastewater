A key component of data analysis is understanding how and where messurement variance occur.
There are 3 components to the variance.

1) Trend variance (total Variance from expected value):
 - var(log(TrendError)) 0.6633979

2) filter variance(variance between filter sample):
 - var(log(FilterError)) is 0.257207

3) well variance(variance between well sample):
 - var(log(wellError)) is 0.1130328

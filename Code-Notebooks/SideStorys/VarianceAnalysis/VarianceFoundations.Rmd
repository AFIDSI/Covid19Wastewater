This is a short document covering some ideas important to all three variance notebooks.

```{r DF Set Up, echo=FALSE}
BaseDir <- params$BaseDir#get the root of the directory where the data is stored
source("../../../lib/DataPathName.R")

HFGDF <- ParseData(HFGWastePath(BaseDir))%>% #Reads in preprocessed data into consistent format
  select(Site,Date,Filter,Well,N1)
tail(HFGDF) #Quick look into structure of data frame
```


The N1 data is log normal. This implies that most variance analysis that attempts to remove error from a base normal phenomenon should work primarily with log N1.

```{r N1 Distribution}

HFGDF%>% # Create a histogram of log N1
  ggplot()+
  aes(x = log(N1))%>%
  geom_histogram()

```

There are two kind issues day of the week can create in data analysis.

  1) The data value depends on the day of the week
  
  2) Missing values concentrate on some weekdays
  
  
The waste water does not significantly depend on the day of the week but there is only half as many entrys for Sunday and only 1 for Saturday meaning that any analysis done will over value weekday trends.

```{r weekend effect proof}
WeekdayDF <- LIMSFullDF%>%
  mutate(weekday=weekdays(Date))%>%
  filter(N1>0,N1Error>0)

WeekdayDF$weekday <- factor(WeekdayDF$weekday,
                        levels= c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday","Friday","Saturday","Sunday"))

WeekdayDF%>%
  group_by(weekday)%>%
  summarize(N1M=mean(N1),n())

summary(aov(N1~weekday,data=WeekdayDF))
```


The case data is heavily dependent on the day of the week with Thursday having nearly twice the amount of cases on average.

```{r smoothed analyis}
WeekdayCaseDF <- LatCaseDF%>%
  mutate(weekday=weekdays(Date))%>%
  filter(Cases>0)
WeekdayDF$weekday <- factor(WeekdayDF$weekday,
                        levels= c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday","Friday","Saturday","Sunday"))

WeekdayCaseDF%>%
  group_by(weekday)%>%
  summarize(CasesM=mean(Cases),n())
#t.test(filter(WeekdayDF,weekday=="Monday")$N1,filter(WeekdayDF,weekday=="Thursday")$N1)

summary(aov(Cases~weekday,data=WeekdayCaseDF))
```
